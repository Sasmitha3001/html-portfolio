  <p> A Passionate 18-Year-Old design student from Gurgaon.
    I am an aspiring designer with a love for the fashion industry. In my free time,I enjoy dancing, listening to music, reading, and cycling. I am a trained Bhartanatyam dancer and a cinephile. I have a strong passion for travel and exploring new places. I hope to pursue a career in fashion communication because of my fascination with the industry's ability to define a person and their personality.
